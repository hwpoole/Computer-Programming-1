Hey all,

The purpose of this repository is to showcase the work I've done so far in my Computer Programming 1 class at Indiana Univeristy. It is my hope that you are able to see my style of work, what it is I'm working on, and what it is I'm learning currently.

If you happen to have any feedback for me based on what you see, please do not hesistate to reach out.

Thanks,

Hunter Poole
